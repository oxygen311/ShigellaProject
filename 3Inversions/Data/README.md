# Data
This directory contains all data used in **3. Rates of rearrangements**.

### Chromosomes_fna/
This directory contains nucleotide sequences of the strains from 6 phylogroups and the MGRA sample. The sequences were used
to find synteny blocks using the **Sibelia** software. Only single-copy synteny blocks were then used to infer the number 
of inversions.

### MGRA_input/
This directory contains input configuration files for **MGRA**. 

### total_stats.csv
The same as `1Tree/Data/total_stats.csv`. This table gives more detail about the 414 strains analysed.
