# Results
This directory contains all results presented in the section **2. Reconstruction of inversion patterns**

### Distance_matrices/
Distance matrices based on single-copy synteny blocks. Each element _xij_ is a number of synteny blocks between a strain _i_ 
and a strain _j_.  

### Figures/
Figures named as in the article.

### MGRA/
MGRA output. Includes reconstructed inversions and genomes, statistics, and files for the tree annotation.

### NJ_trees
The trees based on the obtained matrices and constructed using **PHYLIP** and neighbour-joining algorithm. The directory
also includes annotation files used for **iTOL** visualisation.
