# ShigellaProject
*Shigella* is a well known human pathogen that causes shigellosis. Four *Shigella* species are not valid taxa and are in fact groups within *E. coli*. The recent availability of fully-assembled *Shigella* genomes enabled the investigation of its genome rearrangement patterns. The study of genomic rearrangements in *Shigella* may further the understanding of pathogen bacteria evolution and selection on the architecture of their chromosomes.

This repository contains all data and scripts used in the project. Each directory corresponds to one of the three sections of the article.

### 1Tree
This directory contains data, scripts and results corresponding to **1. Structure of the phylogenetic tree of _E. coli_ and _Shigella_ spp.**

### 2Inversions
This directory contains data, scripts and results corresponding to **2. Reconstruction of inversion patterns**.

### 3ISelements
This directory contains data, scripts and results corresponding to **3. Accumulation of IS elements in _Shigella_ genomes**.
