# ShigellaProject
*Shigella* is a well known human pathogen that causes shigellosis. Four *Shigella* species are not valid taxa and are in fact groups within *E. coli*. The recent availability of fully-assembled *Shigella* genomes enabled the investigation of its genome rearrangement patterns. The study of genomic rearrangements in *Shigella* may further the understanding of pathogen bacteria evolution and selection on the architecture of their chromosomes.

This repository contains all data and scripts used in the project.
