# ShigellaProject
Shigella is a well known human pathogen that causes shigellosis. Shigella species is not a valid taxon and is a group within E. coli. The recent availability of fully-assembled Shigella genomes enabled the investigation of its genome rearrangement patterns. The study of genomic rearrangements in Shigella may further the understanding of pathogen bacteria evolution and selection on the architecture of their chromosomes.
